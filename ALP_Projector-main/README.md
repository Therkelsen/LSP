# ALP Projector
This project was handed to us by Madav, who took sample code and made it work with the projector.
Our goal is to refactor the projector code into a class, from which you can easily interface with 
our or any projector from the same brand of projectors.

## Goals
### Refactor
- [ ] Move everything to a Projector class
- [ ] Generalize the methods to allow for intercompatibility
- [ ] Make member variables with getters/setters
- [ ] Add good comments / fix the ones that arent

### Improve
- [ ] Add projector patterns that seem useful
- [ ] Add user interaction on a higher level than through a main method
- [ ] Remember good comments!
