# ALP Projector
This is a project for LSP, wherein we are to R&D an interface for a projector, and further down the line a camera as well.

The project with pre-existing code was handed to us by Madav, who took sample code and made it work with the projector. Our goal is to refactor the projector code into a class and improve it, from which you can easily interface with our or any projector from the same brand of projectors.

## Goals
### Refactor
- [x] Move everything to a Projector class
- [x] Generalize the methods to allow for intercompatibility
- [x] Make hardcoded variables into member variables with get/set methods
- [ ] Add good comments / fix the ones that arent
- [x] Finding an alternative to memset, for programming patterns

### Improve
- [ ] Add projector patterns that seem useful
- [ ] Prepare for front-end integration, i.e. GUI's etc.
- [ ] Remember good comments!
